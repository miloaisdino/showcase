# schoolbot telegram bot
This project showcases firebase (db) - cloudfunctions (serverless) - dialogflow (gcp) - telegram integration

It was built for a hackathon in 2019, together with teammates Tan Shi Xin and Ria Mundhra.

Back in 2019, ChatGPT wasn't a thing. 
This project approximates a butler service for school work.
It includes features such as homework tracking (CRUD) as well as fun and trivia (calling WolframAlpha API), using Dialogflow, a Google Cloud Platform service to translate natural language calls from telegram into webhook calls to our specified api -- in this case serverless cloud functions.
