# SimplyGO concession pass calculator
## Problem Statement
TransitLink offers 3 types of monthly concession passes to University Students and NSFs:
- Unlimited MRT + Bus rides @ $90.50/mo
- Unlimited Bus rides only @ $55.50/mo
- Unlimited MRT rides only @ $48.00/mo

The usage of monthly concession passes is essential for these two groups as **adult fares are charged for pay-as-you-go usage** 
unlike school students or senior citizens.

This offers a problem where users have to decide if their public transport usage is sufficient to make purchasing a monthly pass worthwhile. 
Also, buying a Bus only pass with pay-as-you-go MRT usage might be cheaper than getting the MRT + Bus pass.

## Solution
This project retrieves and analyses transit info from your SimplyGo account to determine the most cost optimal course of action.
